# Floral Guardian

## Setup Instructions

1. Run `npm install` in the root project folder to install dependencies.
2. (Optional) Start a terminal in `/server` and run `node server.js` to enable API-backed plant data.
3. Run `npm start` to launch the app.
4. Open your browser and go to `http://localhost:3000`.

## Notes

- The `/server` folder is not included in this repository because it contains personal credentials.
- If the server is not running, the app will fall back to local mode using preloaded example plants stored in `src/localPlantData.json`.
- Images for local mode are located in `public/local-images/`.

You can continue developing all features using local mode â€” no server connection required.
